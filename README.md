# DocC Documentation Coverage Visualizer

This is a small SwiftUI project to illustrate how third-party tools could visualize and interact with the **Documentation Coverage** json generated by the [Swift DocC](https://github.com/apple/swift-docc) tool.

It uses the `documentation-coverage.json` structure and turns it into a grouped bar chart showing how many symbols are documented vs the total number available.

## Features

- Decodes a JSON array of coverage data (`docItems.json`)
- Visualizes `documented` vs `total` symbol counts using Swift Charts
- Demonstrates how third-party tools could present documentation metrics in a visual way

## Running the Project in Xcode

1. Open the `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace` in **Xcode 14+**.
2. Build and run the project (`Cmd + R`) in the iOS Simulator or on a real device.

> âœ… The project requires **iOS 16+** due to the use of Swift Charts.
